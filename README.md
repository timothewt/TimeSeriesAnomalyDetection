# Real-time Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series
A real-time anomaly detection system for time series using q/KDB+ and Python.

Currently, only the Python anomaly detection model has been implemented.<br>
The next step of the process is to implement the q/KDB+ real-time data retrieval.<br>
Then, the Python model will be integrated with the q/KDB+ real-time data retrieval.
